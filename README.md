# CodeQuiz

This is an interactive timed quiz that will test your fundamental Javascript knoweldge. The test and time will begin once you hit the "start quiz" button. You will be given a score after completing the quiz. If you would like to gauge your progress against your peers, fill in the input and submit your score to the "scoreboard."

DEAR GRADER,

This was a challenge for me. I understand the basic priciples of Javascript, but really struggle implementing them.

My eventListener to start the Quiz is null. I have reviwed it several times and cannot find where the function is undefined. I created the footer, so you could see the other pages were built.

I think my code is somewhat working, but i cannot get the buttons to render on the page. 

There is a folder called "attempts" that tracks my up and down progress (several different trains of thouhgt) of trying to build this quiz.
